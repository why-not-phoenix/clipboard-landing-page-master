## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

This was a chance for me to practice Bootstrap and also practice refactoring my code. Generally okay with the outcome especially because I didn't need
help to complete it.

### Continued development

The responsiveness was my major challenge and I hope to get better at that.
